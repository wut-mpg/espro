## Task 1

Generate a rectangular signal **A** with 1000 samples and period of 200 samples, with amplitude of 
{-1, +1}. Add Gaussian noise with 0 mean and 0.1 sigma.

## Task 2

Create three simple filters with size of [1x3]:

* **F1** - averaging filter [1/3 1/3 1/3]
* **F2** - Gaussian filter [1/4 1/2 1/4]
* **F3** - edge-detecting filter [-1 0 1]

Convolve input signal **A** with each of filters. What are the results? 
What is the goal of each type of filter? Expand filters to bigger size (e.g. 5x1) 
and apply to signal **A**. What is the difference in result between 3 and 5 element filters? 
Use function `conv`.

## Task 3

Implement your own convolution function using equation from lecture. 
Compare your results with those obtained in task 2. 

## Task 4

Use the random number generator to generate 1000 samples of random signal **B**
(any kind of random signal). Normalize it to have sum of all elements equal 
to one (i.e. `sum(B) = 1`). Convolve signal **B** with itself once: `C = conv(B, B)`
and normalize result to have sum of 1 (i.e. `sum(C) = 1`). Compare signal 
**B** with **C**. Convolve signal **C** with **B** ten more times (`C = conv(C, B)` 
and normalize it every time to 1) and watch the result. 

## Task 5

Repeat task 4, but this time use constant function as input signal **B** (`B = [1 1 1 ...] / 1000`). 
What is the final result this time?
