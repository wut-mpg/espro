## Stationary signal

Generate mixture of three sine waves (use _cos_ function) with different amplitudes, phases and frequencies. Generated signal should have 2 seconds duration and 1kHz sampling rate. Refer to the code below for example.

{% highlight matlab %}

% System parameters
Fs = 1000;       % Sampling frequency [Hz]
T = 1/Fs;        % Sampling time step [s]
s = 2;           % Signal length [s]
L = s*Fs;        % Signal length (number of samples)
t = (0:L-1)*T;   % Time base
f = 0:1/s:Fs/2;  % Frequency base


% Signal creation
N = 3;               % Number of signals
A = [1.0   0.4  0.8] % Amplitude
B = [ 15    27   83] % Frequency [Hz]
C = [  0 -pi/3 pi/7] % Phase shift

% simple way
x = zeros(size(t));
for i = 1:N
  x = x + A(i) * cos(2 * pi * B(i) * t + C(i));
end

% MATLAB way
x = sum(A' .* cos(2 * pi * B' * t + C'));

## Fast Fourier Transform

Calculate Fourier transform of the generated signal (use [fft](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft.html)). Present the result as amplitude and phase shift plots. Read the dominant frequencies, their amplitudes and phase shift. Compare the results with the initial values (used to generate the signal).


{% highlight matlab %}

Y = fft(x);     % Fast Fourier Transform

A = abs(Y);     % Amplitude
A = A/L;        % Amplitude normalization
A = A(1:L/2+1); % Cut important part 
A(2:end-1) = 2*A(2:end-1);

P = angle(Y);   % Phase
P = P(1:L/2+1); % Cut important part

% Plots
figure;
plot(f, A);
xlabel("Frequency [Hz]");
ylabel("Amplitude");
figure;
plot(f, P);
xlabel("Frequency [Hz]");
ylabel("Phase");

{% endhighlight %}

## Noisy signals

Create new signal by adding random noise to signal from previous task (using [randn](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/randn.html) for example). Analyze noisy signal in the same way as the clean one. Find three dominant amplitudes and corresponding phase shifts and frequencies (using [maxk](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/maxk.html) or [sort](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sort.html)) and reconstruct initial signal.

show both signals (noisy and reconstructed) on the same plot. Compare the retrieved values (frequency, amplitude and phase) with the original ones. Experiment with the noise strength - how big it must be to make the original signal unrecoverable?
