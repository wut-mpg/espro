## Course points

Students are collecting assessment points. They come from a continuous assessment in the semester time:
The assessment method of this course consists of: 

   * **laboratory exercises and homework** evaluated during the exercise time (up to 40 pts.), 
   * two tests (0-60 pts.). 

In addition to satisfying the above assessment requirements, every student must satisfy the attendance requirements. 
There is an **obligatory attendance of tutorials** and an optional attendance of the lecture. 
The Pass mark for this course will be set at at 51 pts. (for Robotics) or 60 pts. (for EMARO). 
Credits will be awarded to candidates who pass this course.

## Homework topics

Homework project is done in pairs. Topics focus on audio data analysis - noise reduction,
scene analysis, signal separation and speech features. Tasks (along with sample data
to work with) are available on  [ESPRO course page](https://studia3.elka.pw.edu.pl/file/19Z/103A-ARxxx-MSA-ESPRO/priv/).
Each task can be taken by **at most** two groups.  

## Points will be cut for:

   * repetitive code fragments - instead use loops (e.g. for, while),
   * hardcoded values like vector lengths - instead use variables or function parameters,
   * bad code style - for every task create a Matlab function making all the computations, if necessary use more functions for doing internal computations,
   * lack of comments in code.

## Plagiarism policy

Based on some cases from previous years, here are some important reminders.
You should work on your own (or in pairs in case of the project), and all of your 
code should be written by you. If you take some functions from external sources
(Mathworks FileExchange, Stack Overflow etc.) you must clearly state that
(i.e. in code comments, in the report). Removing original author notes 
and license information will be treated as plagiarism. 

You are allowed (and we encourage you to do so!) to discuss the tasks 
in bigger group to better understand them, but finally all the codes
should be written individually. You can discuss the methods, the theory
behind the problem, the possible solutions. 

And finally, ยง 19, point 4 of [Academic Regulations](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw/Academics/Academic-Regulations):

*If during the verification of learning outcomes achievement, it is established that the
student works with external assistance or uses materials or devices unauthorised by the
course regulations, the student shall be awarded a fail grade and shall lose the right to
pass the course being currently pursued.*

In short words - the whole course is failed in case of plagiarism.
